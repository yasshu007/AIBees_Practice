Internet Connectivity Issue,Inquiry_Help,Internal Application,Network,"Issue: Internet Connectivity Issue

Resolution:
Basic Checks:
Restart your modem and router: This can often resolve temporary glitches and improve performance. 
Assess the bandwidth: Use a bandwidth check tool to see if your connection is consistently slower than usual. 
Check for Wi-Fi signal strength: Ensured the device is close to the router and that the signal isn't being obstructed by thick walls or electronic devices. 
Use wired connections when possible: Tried Ethernet connections which generally more reliable and faster than Wi-Fi. 

Troubleshooting Steps:
Check for outages: If the problem is widespread, it could be an area outage. 
Scanned for malware: Malware can drain bandwidth and slow down your connection. 
Update firmware: Outdated firmware can cause performance issues and slow speeds. 
Contact your ISP: If the issue persists, your ISP can help diagnose and resolve problems on their end. 

Reduce background apps and processes: Close unnecessary programs and browser tabs to free up bandwidth. 
Cleared browser cache and history: This can improve browsing speed and reduce lag. 
Checked for signal interference: Wireless interference can affect Wi-Fi performance, so try changing your Wi-Fi channel or repositioning your router. 
Manage network congestion: If you have many devices connected, consider limiting usage during peak times or optimizing your network configuration. 


Advanced Troubleshooting:
Consider upgrading your router or ISP plan:
Older routers or low-bandwidth plans may not be sufficient for your needs. 
Use a VPN:
If you're experiencing throttling or network congestion, a VPN can help bypass these issues. 
Check your network settings:
Incorrect settings can cause connectivity problems, so reviewed your configuration.
